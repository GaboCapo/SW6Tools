**Requirements**

As prefered in the [SWDocs](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-platform-dev-en/getting-started/requirements) we use an Ubuntu 18.04 (in my Case Desktop) environment.

After install the OS, I setup a tool called [timeshift](https://github.com/teejee2008/timeshift) to take snapshots of the system, so we can reset the system to an older version when there are some issues while the configuration.
